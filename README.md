Goal: To understand basic crawling, and use simple heuristics to handle real world unclean web data to get email ids. 

Task: We were provided with 2000 business webpages crawled from Yelp. Each webpage is an HTML containing details about
the business. It does not have the email id, but it has the website address for the business which can be used to find
the contact us page for the website and thereby extract its email id. Your task is to obtain structured data for the 
business: business name, business phone number, business home page URL, contact‚Äêus URL for the business, email id for 
the business. 
 
The file Business Sites.tar.gz contains 2000 html files from business1.html to business2000.html 
which correspond to html for business ids 1 to 2000.
